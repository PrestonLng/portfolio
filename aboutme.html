                <h2>Spencer Lang</h2>
                <p> Hello! my name is Spencer Lang, a web developer and Snow Sport enjoyer who finds inspiration both in code and on the mountains. 
                    As a Computer Science graduate from the University of Oregon, I specialize in creating dynamic, responsive, 
                    and user-centric digital experiences. This portfolio, hosted on GitHub, showcases my achievements and growth during 
                    my first year as a developer. Through my work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, I've developed 
                    the ability to craft intuitive interfaces that engage users and elevate their experience. 
                </p>
                
                <p> Outside of coding, Im often hitting the slopes, whether it's skiing down the mountains or exploring new ski resorts. From 
                    challenging black diamond runs to enjoying serene, powder-filled trails, skiing has always been my passion. It's more than 
                    just an exhilarating sport it's a way for me to disconnect from the vast digital world and embrace the beauty of the mountains. 
                </p>
                
                <p> My mission is to inspire others to find a balance between technology and the outdoors. Whether you're looking for web development 
                    insights or recommendations for the best ski resorts, Im eager to share my passion and experiences with you. Lets connect, share 
                    our experiences and help others find what they enjoy. Lets make every step count whether its in the digital world or at a ski resort
                    a memorable adventure. 
                </p>
